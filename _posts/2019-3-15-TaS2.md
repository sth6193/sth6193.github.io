title:      Electrons Stuck in 1D - Wigner Crystallization in TaS<sub>2</sub>
date:       2019-3-15 12:00:00
summary:    When electron-electron interactions have a larger energy scale than their kinetic energy, they can crystallize in electronic Wigner crystals. In a specific domain wall in TaS<sub>2</sub>, we see behavior expected of a Wigner crystal along the domain wall. This result is the first observation of a Wigner Crystal in a Mott Insulator, a material class known for its strong electron-electron correlations.

One of the first problems Physics undergraduate students study in quantum mechanics is the particle in a box. In this system the particle cannot pass through the walls of the box but has to "bounce" around inside. Some work with the Schr&ouml;dinger equation and you will find energy of the particle will scale with the box size as \\( \propto L^{-2} \\) if \\( L \\) is the size of the box. A natural way to think about this is if you shrink the size of the box, then the energy will go up and vice versa. More confinement giving a higher energy state is seen elsewhere in Physics, most accessibly in the ideal gas law.

Another concept in introductory Physics is Coulombs law, which describes the interaction between electric charges. The potential energy in Coulombs law (which is related to an integral of the actual law) scales with distance as \\( \propto L^{-1} \\) where \\( L \\) is the separation distance between the charges. Adding this potential into the Schr&ouml;dinger equation within a crystal is actually pretty difficult. Current methods to doing this are mostly computational and scale very fast with system size.

In the 1930s, a Physicist name Eugene Wigner thought about what would happen to a very sparse collection of electrons in a material. At first glance, you might think that fewer electrons equals fewer electron-electron interactions. And this is true. But what really matters in physics is relative energy scales. What allows electrons to move around freely is that their kinetic energy is larger than the energy of forces trying to localize them. And when electrons become really sparse, you can think about making the box/separation distance bigger by increasing \\( L \\). At some value of \\( L \\), the electron-electron interactions will dominate since they scale as \\( \propto L^{-1} \\) compared to \\( \propto L^{-2} \\). Wigner predicted that when this happens, the electrons will from a crystal different than the underlying lattice known now as a Wigner crystal.

### Wigner Crystal in CDW Domain Wall in TaS<sub>2</sub>

Finding a material where electron-electron interactions dominate is not that easy. Most realizations of Wigner Crystals are in lightly doped semiconductors where a very small density gives electrons low enough kinetic energy to crystallize. However, it is also possible to have large electron correlations and only moderately small kinetic energy. This is what we observed in TaS<sub>2</sub>. TaS<sub>2</sub> is a known Mott Insulator. Mott insulators are materials which conventionally should be a metal based on their band structure, but electron-electron correlations are strong enough to make the material insulating.

It also has a charge density wave. Charge density waves (CDWs) are periodic modulations of charge within the crystal with a different periodicity than the underlying lattice. Within TaS<sub>2</sub>, the Mott insulating state and the CDW physics are intimately linked. These modulations of charge are "lockstep" over regions of the crystal, but there are areas when this lockstep can shift locally. Sort of like a Sine function becoming a Cosine function locally. On either side of these areas the modulation is locked in, but along these regions there is a local shift. Within the physics community we call these "domain walls".

Along a particular type of domain wall in TaS<sub>2</sub>, we see that the material becomes metallic. Interestingly, we see that at specific energies there are patterns of charge that match the prediction for Wigner Crystallization in 1D (**b** and **c** in the picture below). In fact, an important result from a group at UIUC ([with over 14k citations!](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.566)) predicts the criterion for Wigner Crystallization in 1D. Checking for our special domain wall in TaS<sub>2</sub>, we find that this system fits the criteria!

There is still a lot left to study within this material. We see that there is extra noise on the locations of the Wigner crystal. We think that this noise could be from charge hopping on and off these locations. But coming up with an effective model is still left to be done and it is unclear whether our instrument has the necessary temporal bandwidth to resolve these features.
