Welcome to my personal website! I'm Sean Howard, currently a Physics Graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I'm using this website to host some projects I've done, show bits of my research that may be interesting, and post any general updates.

In the lab, my research uses [Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope) to study and image emergent phases of matter in quantum materials. Broadly speaking, quantum materials have properties that cannot be explained using "classical" or "conventional" theories. Check out our [group website](http://madhavanlab.org/) I made for more info! I also designed and built an STM and use that to run my experiments.

Outside the lab I enjoy using math and programming to solve interesting questions. When I have time I play pick up basketball and try to avoid another sports injury. I used to golf semi-competitively, but the grad student life doesn't give me the time/money to golf much. I also dry cure my own meats to go with some nice cheese, beer, and friends.

I'm from Racine, Wisconsin home of the [Kringle](https://www.kringle.com/about/what-is-a-kringle), SC Johnson, and [a long lost NFL team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racine_Legion). There's also some Frank Lloyd Wright buildings around town. I went to undergrad at University of Notre Dame where I majored in Physics. While there I did some work trying to develop a carbon dating process for Notre Dame at their Nuclear Laboratory. Then I couldn't figure out how to leave the Midwest and went to the cornfields of central Illinois where I currently reside. But not for long! I am hoping to graduate in 2020 and get a job outside of academia (and outside of Champaign). Get in touch if you find anything here interesting!
